Hi Manish,
As per our discussions this afternoon, the amount charged by the hotel for Check #0010390 (dated 8th August 2016) for Room #319 for Tanmay Srivastava (SOEID TS64922) needs to be updated. A food item has been charged for twice.

The current bill mentions the value as INR 2568.50, while the updated value for the same should be INR 1284.25. Kindly make the necessary change and ensure that the same is reflected in the total amount charged for that week.

Please click ‘Reply All’ on this email and send the updated invoice to us latest by tomorrow afternoon, as promised by you.

(I stayed at Radisson Blu between 17th July, 2016 and 16th August, 2016 as a part of the Citi Grads batch of 2016.)

Thanks,
Tanmay Srivastava,
